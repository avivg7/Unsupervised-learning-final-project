# Unsupervised Learning BIU 2023 Final Project

Please see below all the relevant information for the submission.<br>
All you need, is to run the relevant notebook.<br><br>
Note: In each of the notebooks except the notebook that deals with the music data, there is a "Gdown" command that allows the relevant data to be downloaded.
Unfortunately the music data file was too big for us to upload..<br>
