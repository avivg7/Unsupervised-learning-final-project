# Unsupervised Learning BIU 2023 Final Project

Please see below all the relevant information for the submission.<br>
All you need, is to run the relevant notebook.<br><br>
Note: In each of the notebooks except the notebook that deals with the music data, there is a "Gdown" command that allows the relevant data to be downloaded.
Unfortunately the music data file was too large for us to upload.<br>
If you want to download the the "Music data set" you can do it in the following link:
