# Unsupervised Learning BIU 2023 Final Project

Please see below all the relevant information for the submission.<br>
All you need, is to run the relevant notebook.<br><br>
Note: In each of the notebooks except the notebook that deals with the music data, there is a "Gdown" command that allows the relevant data to be downloaded.
Unfortunately the music data file was too large for us to upload.<br>
If you want to download the the "Music data set" you can do it in the following link:<br>

    ├── README.md                                       # README file containing instructions on how to run the notebooks
    └── requirements.txt                                # Pip requirements for the project

## Requirements note :
Before running the notebook, in order to install all dependencies, please run the following command:.<br>

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to run the different notebooks :

### Deezer_Ego_Nets_clustering.ipynb : 
<ol type="1">
	<li>Run the first two code cells to download the dataset and extract the zip file.</li>
	<li>In the third code cell, select the path where the folder containing the data is located.</li>
	<li>Run the rest of the cells as you wish</li>
</ol>

### Gas_Sensor_Array_Drift_clustering.ipynb : 
<ol type="1">
	<li>Run the first two code cells to download the dataset and extract the zip file.</li>
	<li>In the third code cell, select the path where the folder containing the data is located.</li>
	<li>Run the rest of the cells as you wish</li>
</ol>


### Gas_Sensor_Array_Drift_clustering.ipynb : 
<ol type="1">
	<li>Download the "Music data set" from the following link: <a href="https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip">Click here"</a></li>
	<li>In the first code cell, select the path where the folder containing the data is located.</li>
